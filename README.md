# SneakerChain

SneakerChain is a decentralized marketplace for authenticated physical sneakers, represented on‑chain as ERC‑1155 tokens. Each sneaker—or fractional share of a high‑value sneaker—is minted as an NFT, providing immutable provenance and eliminating counterfeits. Buyers can purchase outright or participate in sealed‑bid auctions, with on‑chain downpayments and a pull‑over‑push escrow model that ensures secure, trustless settlements.

## Features

- **Authentication & Provenance**  
  Physical sneakers are authenticated off‑chain, then minted on‑chain as ERC‑1155 tokens, with full ownership history recorded in the metadata.

- **Fractional Ownership**  
  Sneakers above a configurable threshold can be split into 100 shares, letting collectors buy a stake rather than the entire pair.

- **Instant Purchase & Auctions**  
  – **Buy Now** at a fixed price per share.  
  – **7‑day sealed‑bid auctions** with on‑chain downpayments, automated finalize‑after‑time, and pull‑pattern refunds & payouts.

- **Secure Escrow & Withdrawals**  
  All ETH is held in escrow until settlement; outbid bidders and sellers (plus platform commissions) “withdraw” their funds via a pull‑over‑push pattern.

- **Platform Commission**  
  A configurable fee on every sale is automatically tracked and withdrawable by the contract owner.
